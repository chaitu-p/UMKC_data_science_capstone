Potential Extensions
Participants can extend their applications by:

Improving the UI: Add better navigation, styling, or more detailed visualizations for the predictions.
Adding More Models: Integrate multiple models to allow for different tasks (e.g., both sentiment analysis and summarization).
Deployment: Guide participants to deploy their Streamlit apps on platforms like Heroku or Streamlit Cloud.

By following this step-by-step approach, participants will be able to successfully set up, build, and test a fully functional Streamlit application that integrates both deep learning and language models.
