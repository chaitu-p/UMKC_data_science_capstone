App Testing
Encourage participants to thoroughly test their applications by providing different inputs.

Steps:

Test Image Classification:

Upload various images to see how the model performs. Test with both simple and complex images.
Test Text Summarization:

Input various types of text (short, long, factual, or creative) to see how well the language model summarizes the input.
Check Performance:

Ensure that the application runs smoothly by checking the latency of model predictions and the responsiveness of the app.
