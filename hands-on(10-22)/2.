Model Preparation
Next, load and prepare a deep learning or language model. Ensure the models are optimized for inference locally or on edge devices.

Steps:

Deep Learning Model (e.g., ResNet for Image Classification):

We’ll use a pre-trained ResNet model from PyTorch’s torchvision library.
Use the following to load the model:
python
import torch
from torchvision import models

# Load pre-trained ResNet model
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode
LLM (e.g., Summarization using Hugging Face Transformers):

Load a pre-trained language model for tasks like summarization or sentiment analysis:
python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load summarization pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
Optimize Models for Inference:

Ensure the models are in evaluation mode by using .eval().
For local inference, ensure that the device (CPU or GPU) is appropriately used. You can move the model to a device using:
python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
