Environment Setup
To begin, participants should set up their development environment by installing the necessary libraries for Streamlit and the models they plan to use, such as PyTorch (for deep learning) or Hugging Face (for language models).

Steps:

Install Python (if not installed): Ensure that Python (version 3.7 or higher) is installed. You can download it from here.

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv streamlit_env
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: streamlit_env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux: source streamlit_env/bin/activate
Install Streamlit:

bash
pip install streamlit
Install necessary libraries: Depending on the models you plan to use, install the required libraries:

For PyTorch (deep learning models):
bash
pip install torch torchvision Pillow

For Hugging Face Transformers (LLM models):
bash
pip install transformers
Run the Streamlit app: After installing the libraries, you can start Streamlit by running:

bash
streamlit run app.py
