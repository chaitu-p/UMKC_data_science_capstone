Building the Streamlit Interface
Guide participants in creating an interactive interface where users can provide input, such as image uploads or text areas.

Steps:

Create File Upload for Image Classification:

Use Streamlit's file_uploader() for uploading images:
python
uploaded_image = st.file_uploader("Choose an image...", type="jpg")
if uploaded_image is not None:
    image = Image.open(uploaded_image)
    st.image(image, caption='Uploaded Image', use_column_width=True)
Create Text Area for LLM Tasks:

Use text_area() for entering text to be processed by the LLM model:
python
user_text = st.text_area("Enter text for summarization")
Add buttons for triggering model inference:

For example, a button to trigger the summarization process:
python
if st.button("Summarize"):
    summary = summarizer(user_text, max_length=50, min_length=25, do_sample=False)
    st.write("Summary:", summary[0]['summary_text'])
